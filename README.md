Hello! 👋 I'm Josselyn A. Ludeña Pilay
Front-End Developer | Mom
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Front-End Developer and a mom. I have previous experience in the financial sector, where I developed communication and problem-solving skills to ensure customer satisfaction. Some time ago, I discovered the world of web development and fell in love with the process of programming websites, games, applications, and other digital projects. That's why I decided to pursue a professional career in this field to fulfill my passion for creativity and innovation.
